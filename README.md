### Status
Currently Tweeting the Hadiths from Sahih al-Bukhari in serial.

### Concept
It's really simple. GitHub action is written in <a href="/.github/workflows/tweet_hadith.yml">this</a> file. You can notice a scheduler - 
```
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 */1 * * *"
```
And the rest of the process is self explanatory.

A tracker is used to put the latest Tweeted Hadith number in the `hadith_track.json` file. 


### Flow
```
Get last Tweeted Hadith number from tracker
                    тнг
          Get Hadith from API 
                    тнг
      Make chunks for long Hadith
                    тнг
   Limit chunks for very long Hadith 
                    тнг
        Tweet and comment chunks
                    тнг
              Update tracker
```

### Contribution
